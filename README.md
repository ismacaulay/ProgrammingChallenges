=====================

These solved solutions of programming challenges presented in Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual (S. Skiena, M. Revilla) and on UVa Online Judge. All solutions are one implementation of the problem and will work with uva.onlinejudge.com automated judge using the c++11 compiler.

Each problem is unit tested using the google-test framework. The input.txt and output.txt files for each problem are the example inputs and ouputs. The submission build will verify that the output matches that of the expected output.
