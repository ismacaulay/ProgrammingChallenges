ProgrammingChallenges
=====================

These are solved solutions of programming challenges available on UVa Online Judge (uva.onlinejudge.com). All solutions are one implementation of the problem and will work with the automated judge using the c++11 compiler.

Each problem is unit tested (unless the problem was too easy and didnt warrent tests) using the google-test framework. The input.txt and output.txt files for each problem are the example inputs and ouputs.
